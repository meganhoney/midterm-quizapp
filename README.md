# SpoOokle - A Quiz App

SpoOkle is a quiz app where users can take publically available quizzes and share their results with friends. Users can create quizzes, for public or private use, and share with friends. Users can also keep track of quizzes they have created to see how other users do with their questions.

## Features



## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository to your local environment.
2. Create the `.env` by using `.env.example` as a reference: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Update the .env file with your correct local information 
4. Install dependencies: `npm i`
5. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
6. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
7. Run the server: `npm run local`
  - Note: nodemon is used, so you should not have to restart your server
8. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`

## Notes & Future Improvements

- To make styling changes, not edit the `.css` files directly (`/public/styles`), they are auto-generated by `.scss` files.
- The user login is currently hard coded. We would like to add login functionality.
